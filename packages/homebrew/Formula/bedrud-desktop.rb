  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Bedrud Desktop requires a running Bedrud server to connect to.
      For self-hosting instructions, see:
        https://themadorg.github.io/bedrud/getting-started/installation/

      On first launch, macOS Gatekeeper may block the app since it is not
      notarized. Right-click the binary and select "Open" to bypass this.
